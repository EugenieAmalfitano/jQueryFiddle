<H2>Pa's Fiddle Music </h2>


Pa's fiddle was an important part of Laura's childhood, and his music is
mentioned quite frequently in her books.  Pa had a song to fit every occasion,
whether happy or sad.  Some of the songs Pa sang are still commonly known
today, and others are not.  Here, you can listen to midi files of several songs
he often played, as well as a few other songs mentioned in Laura's books that
were not played on the fiddle.    While the music on this page is not truly played on a fiddle, as it is
computer-generated, you can at least hear the tunes to the songs Laura clapped
and danced to so often as a child.

<em> And that night, for a special birthday treat, 
Pa played "Pop Goes the Weasel" for her.<P>
"Pop! (said Pa's finger on the string)<BR>
 Goes the weasel! (sang the fiddle, plain as plain.)" <P>
 But Laura 
and Mary hadn't seen Pa's finger make the string pop.</Em><P>

Devil's Dream</a>, <A HREF="monymusk.mid">Money Musk</A>, and 
<A HREF="arktrvlr.mid">Arkansas Traveler</A><P>

<em>The room was still and warm and full of firelight.  Ma's shadow, 
and Aunt Eliza's and Uncle Peter's were big and quivering on the walls
in the flickering firelight, and Pa's fiddle sang merrily to itself.<P>
It sang "Money Musk," and "The Red Heifer," "The Devil's Dream," and
"Arkansas Traveler."</Em><P>

</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="nellygray.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif">Nelly Gray</A><P>

<EM>And Laura went to sleep while Pa and the fiddle were both softly
singing:<P>
"My darling Nelly Gray, they have taken you away,<BR>
And I'll never see my darling any more..."</EM><P>

</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="buffalo.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> Buffalo Gals</A><P>

<EM>Laura watched Ma's skirt swaying and her little waist bending and 
her dark head bowing, and she thought Ma was the loveliest dancer in 
the world.  The fiddle was singing:<P>

"Oh, you Buffalo gals, <BR>
Aren't you coming out tonight...<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>Little House in the Big Woods, <EM>Dance at 
Grandpa's</EM></strong></font><P>

<A HREF="irishwsh.mid"><IMG
SRC="cello.gif">  Irish Washerwoman</a><P>

<EM>Laura watched the dancers again.  Pa was playing "The Irish
Washerwoman" now.  He called:<P>

"Doe see, ladies, doe see doe,<BR>
Come down heavy on your heel and toe!"<P>
Laura could not keep her feet still.<P></Em>

</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="auld.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif">  Auld
Lang Syne</a><P>

<EM>Then Pa began to play again the song about Old Grimes.  But he did
not sing the words he had sung when Ma was making cheese.  These words
were different.  Pa's strong, sweet voice was softly singing...<P>
When the fiddle had stopped singing Laura called out softly, "What are
the days of auld lang syne, Pa?"<P>
"They are the days of a long time ago, Laura," Pa said.</EM><P>

<A HREF="yankee.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif">  Yankee
Doodle</a><P>

<EM>Pa was keeping time with his foot, and Laura clapped her hands
to the music when he sang,<P>
"And I'll sing Yankee Doodle-de-do..."</EM><P>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>Little House in the Big Woods, <em>
Winter Days</Em>
</strong></font><P>

<EM>Laura stood up on the board and Pa held her safe by the arm, so 
she could see the town.  When she saw it, she could hardly breathe. 
She knew how Yankee Doodle felt, when he could not see the town
because there were so many houses.</EM><P>

</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="rockages.mid"><IMG
SRC="cello.gif"> Rock of Ages</A><P>

<em>Laura and Mary lay in their trundle bed and listened to the Sunday
hymns, for even the fiddle must not sing the week-day songs on 
Sundays.<P>
"Rock of Ages, cleft for me," Pa sang, with the fiddle.<P></EM>
<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>Little House in the Big Woods, <em>

</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="soldier.mid"><IMG
SRC="cello.gif"> Am I a Soldier of the Cross?</a><P>

<EM>Then he sang:<P>
"Shall I be carried to the skies,<BR>
On flowery beds of ease,<BR>
While others fought to win the prize,<BR>
And sailed through bloody seas?"<P>

Laura began to float away on the music, and then she heard a clattering
noise, and there was Ma by the stove, getting breakfast.<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>Little House in the Big Woods, <em>

</strong></font><P>


<A HREF="osusanna.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> Oh
Susanna!<P></A>

<EM>She sat down beside Pa at the fire, and Pa took his fiddle out of
the box and began to play.<P>
"Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me," the fiddle wailed, and Pa
began to sing."<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>Little House on the Prairie, <em>
Going Out</Em>
</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="dan.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> Old Dan Tucker</A>
<P>

<EM>"Play, Ingalls!" he said.  "Play me down the road!"  So while he went
down the creek road and out of sight, Pa played, and Pa and Mr. Edwards 
and Laura sang with all their might...<P>

Far over the prairie rang Pa's big voice and Laura's little one,
and faintly from the creek bottoms came a last whoop from Mr. Edwards.<P>

"Git out of the way for Old Dan Tucker!<BR>
He's too late to get his supper!"<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>Little House on the Prairie, <em>
The House on the Prairie</Em>
</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="laurel.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif">Green Grows the Laurel</A><P>

<EM>But when they were in bed he took down his fiddle.  Softly he played
and softly sang,<P>
"So green grows the laurel,<BR>
And so does the rue,<BR>
So woeful, my love,<BR>
At the parting with you."<P>

Ma turned toward him and smiled.<P></em>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>Little House on the Prairie,</em>

<A HREF="dixie.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> 
Dixie</A><P>

<EM>Then Ma laughed, and Pa and the fiddle sang again.<P>

"In Dixie land I'll take my stand,<BR>
And live and die in Dixie!<BR>
Away, away, away, away,<BR>
Away down south in Dixie!"<P>

They sang with a lilt and a swing that almost lifted Laura right
out of bed.<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>Little House on the Prairie, <em>
Going Out</Em>
</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="rally.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif">Rally Round the Flag</A><P>

<EM>The fiddle began to play a marching tune, and Pa's clear voice 
was singing like a deep-toned bell.<P>

"We'll rally round the flag, boys,<BR>
We'll rally once again,<BR>
Shouting the battle-cry of Freedom!"<P>

Laura felt that she must shout too.<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>Little House on the Prairie,<EM>

<A HREF="wagon.mid"><IMG
SRC="cello.gif"> Wait for the Wagon</A><P>

<EM>Pa was whistling, and when Sam and David started he began to sing.<P>

"Oh, every Sunday morning<BR>
My wife is by my side<BR>
A-waiting for the wagon,<BR>
And we'll all take a ride!"<P>

"Charles," Ma said, softly, to remind him that this was Sunday.<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>On the Banks of Plum Creek, <em>
Going to Church</Em>
</strong></font><P>



<A HREF="jerugold.mid"> <IMG SRC="cello.gif"> Jerusalem, the Golden</a><P>

<EM>After that everyone stood up.  They all opened their mouths and
tried to sing "Jerusalem, the Golden."  Not many of them knew the
words or the tune.  Miserable squiggles went up Laura's backbone and
the insides of her ears crinkled.  She was glad when they all sat
down again.<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>On the Banks of Plum Creek, <em>
Going to Church</Em>
</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="ringrosy.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> Ring Around the Rosy</a><P>

<EM>The little girls always played ring-around-a-rosy, because Nellie
Oleson said to.  They got tired of it, but they always played it,
till one day, before Nellie could say anything, Laura said, "Let's
play Uncle John!"<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>On the Banks of Plum Creek, <em>
Nellie Oleson</Em>
</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="campbell.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> The Campbells Are Coming</A><P>

<EM>He played "The Campbells Are Coming, Hurrah! Hurrah!"</EM><P>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>On the Banks of Plum Creek, <EM>

<A HREF="girl.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif">  The
Girl I Left Behind Me</a> and <A HREF="whenjohn.mid">When Johnny 
Comes Marching Home</A><P>

<em>After supper, when night and lamplight came, Pa took his fiddle
out of the box and tuned it lovingly.<P>
"I have missed this," he said, looking around at them all.  Then
he began to play.  He played "When Johnnie Comes Marching Home."  He 
played "The sweet little girl, the pretty little girl, the girl I 
left behind me!"<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>On the Banks of Plum Creek, <em>
Going to Town</Em>
</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="kentucky.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> My Old Kentucky Home</A>
 and <A HREF="swanee.mid">Swanee River</A><P>

<em>He played and sang "My Old Kentucky Home" and "Swanee River."<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>On the Banks of Plum Creek, <em>
Going to Town</Em>
</strong></font><P>


<A HREF="lilydale.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif">
 Lily Dale</A><P>

<EM>Then the fiddle changed the tune and Pa began to sing about 
sweet Lily Dale.<P>
"Twas a calm, still night,<BR>
And the moon's pale light<BR>
Shone soft o'er hill and dale...<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>On the Banks of Plum Creek,<EM>
Christmas Eve</EM></strong></font><P>

<A HREF="polly.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> 
Polly, Put the Kettle On</A><P>

<EM>Pa glanced at Ma, busy at the stove, while Mary and Laura sat 
listening, and the fiddle slipped into frolicking up and down with
his voice.<P>

"Mary put the dishes on,<BR>
The dishes on, the dishes on,<BR>
Mary put the dishes on,<BR>
We'll all take tea!"<P>

"And what shall I do, Pa?" Laura cried, while Mary ran to get the plates
and cups from the cupboard.  The fiddle and Pa kept singing, down all the
steps they had just gone up.<P>

"Laura take them off again,<BR>
Off again, off again,<BR>
Laura clear the table when<BR>
We've all gone away!"<P>

So Laura knew that Mary was to set the table for supper and she was 
to clear away afterward.<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>On the Banks of Plum Creek, <em>
Christmas Eve</Em>
</strong></font><P>


<A HREF="broom.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> Buy a Broom</A><P>

<EM>But Laura liked the waltz songs best.  She loved the Broom song, 
though they had to sing "broom" so many times to make the tune swing.<P>

"Buy a broo-oom, buy a broom, broom!<BR>
Buy a broom, broom, buy a broom, broom!<BR>
Will you buy of this wandering Bavarian a broom?<P></EM>

Wonderful Afternoon</EM></strong></font><P>

<A HREF="hail.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> Hail, Columbia</A><P>

<EM>Ma rocked Grace slowly to and fro, and Laura brought Pa the 
fiddle box.  Now the happy winter evenings were begun. <P>

"Hail, ye heroes, Heaven born band!<BR>
Firm, united let us be,<BR>
Rallying 'round our liberty,<BR>
As a band of brothers joined<BR>
Peace and safety we shall find.<BR>
Hail, Columbia, happy land!" (Pa sang with the fiddle.)</EM><P>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>By the Shores of Silver Lake, <em>
Last Man Out</EM></strong></font><P>

<A HREF="hmary.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> Highland Mary</A><P>

<EM>He looked at Mary sitting quietly with beautiful empty eyes and 
folded hands in her rocking chair by the oven.  "What shall I play 
for you, Mary?"<P>

"I would like to hear 'Highland Mary', Pa."<P>

Softly Pa played a verse.  "Now, Mary! Help sing!" he said, and they 
sang together.<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>By the Shores of Silver Lake, <em>

<A HREF="bonniedo.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif">
Bonnie Doon</A><P>

<EM>Laura had never been so happy, and for some reason she was
happiest of all when they were singing,<P>
"Ye banks and braes of Bonny Doon,<BR>
How can ye bloom sae fresh and fair?<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>By the Shores of Silver Lake, <em>
Happy Winter Days</Em>
</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="cominrye.mid"> <IMG SRC="cello.gif"> Coming Through the Rye</a><P>

<EM>So gaily all together they sang the lively song.  And Laura got 
up and pretended to be wading across a creek, holding her skirts
above her ankles and laughing back over her shoulder, singing:<P>

"Ilka lassie has her laddie,<BR>
Nane, they say, ha'e I,<BR>
Yet all the lads they smile at me<BR>
When coming through the Rye."<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>By the Shores of Silver Lake, <em>
Last Man Out</Em>
</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="mcmas.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> Merry Christmas Everywhere</a><P>

<EM>He raised the fiddle again from its nest in the box and tried it
to see that it was in tune.  "What'll it be, Boast?"<P>

"'Merry Christmas Everywhere,'" said Mr. Boast.  His tenor voice
joined Pa's bass.  Mrs. Boast's soft alto and Laura's soprano and 
Mary's  followed, then Ma's contralto.  Carrie's little treble
piped up happily.<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>By the Shores of Silver Lake, <em>
Night Before Christmas</Em>
</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="horsshoe.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> Keep the Horseshoe Hung Over the Door</a><P>

<EM>Over the door Pa hung his rifle and his shotgun, and then he hung
on a nail above them a bright, new horseshoe...<P>
Ma's eyes smiled into his eyes, and he said to Laura, "I could sing 
you a song about that horseshoe."<P>
She brought him the fiddle box, and he sat down in the doorway and 
tuned the fiddle.  Ma settled in her chair to rock Grace to sleep. 
Softly Laura washed the dishes and Carrie wiped them while Pa
played the fiddle and sang...<P>

"Keep the horseshoe hung over the door!<BR>
It will bring you good luck evermore.<BR>
If you would be happy and free from all care,<BR>
Keep the horseshoe hung over the door!"<P>

"It sounds rather heathenish to me, Charles," Ma said.<P></Em>

</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="billy.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> Billy Boy</A><P>

<EM>His eyes twinkled at Ma while the music laughed and whirled and 
then he would sing:<P>

She can make a cherry pie,<BR>
Billy boy!  Billy boy!<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>By the Shores of Silver Lake, <em>
Happy Winter Days</Em>
</strong></font><P>


<A HREF="camptown.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> Camptown Races</a><P>

<EM>The music would go rollicking while only Pa and Mr. Boast sang:<P>

"I bet my money on the bob-tailed mare<BR>
And you bet yours on the gray!"<P>

Even in songs Ma did not approve of gambling, but her toe could not
stop tapping while Pa played such tunes.<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>By the Shores of Silver Lake, <em>
Happy Winter Days</Em>
</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="mice.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> Three Blind Mice</a><P>

<EM>Then every evening they all sang one round.  Mr. Boast's tenor
would begin, "Three blind mice," and go on while Mrs. Boast's alto
began, "Three blind mice," then as she went on Pa's bass would join
in, "Three blind mice," and then Laura's soprano, and Ma's contralto,
and Mary and Carrie.  When Mr. Boast reached the end of the song he
began it again without stopping, and they all followed, each behind
the other, going round and round with words and music.<P></EM>
<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>By the Shores of Silver Lake, <em>

</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="benbolt.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> Ben Bolt</A> and <A HREF="stilly.mid">Oft in the Stilly Night</A><P>

<EM>And then Pa would play some of the old songs, "to go to sleep on,"
 he said....<P>
"Oh, do you remember sweet Alice, Ben Bolt?<BR>
Sweet Alice with eyes so brown<BR>
Who wept with delight when you gave her a smile,<BR>
And trembled with fear at your frown?"<P>

And,<P>

"Oft in the stilly night,<BR>
Ere slumber's chain has bound me,<BR>
Sweet memory brings the light<BR>
Of other days around me.<P></EM>

<A HREF="barbara.mid"><IMG
SRC="cello.gif"> Barbary Allen</A> <P>

<EM>Pa was singing with the fiddle:<P>

"In Scarlet town where I was born,<BR>
There was a fair maid dwellin'<BR>
And every youth cried 'Well-a-wa.'<BR>
Her name was Barbary Allen.<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>By the Shores of Silver Lake, <em>

</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="home.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> Home Sweet Home</A><P>

<EM>And, as she fell asleep still thinking of violets and fairy 
rings and moonlight over the wide, wide land, where their very own 
homestead lay, Pa and the fiddle were softly singing:<P>

"Home! Home! Sweet, sweet home,<BR>
Be it ever so humble,<BR>
There is no place like home."<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>By the Shores of Silver Lake, <em>
Evening Shadows Fall</EM>
</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="trouble.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> I am as Happy as a Big Sunflower</A><P>

<EM>Laura woke up suddenly.  She heard singing and a queer slapping 
sound.<P>

"Oh, I am as happy as a big sunflower (Slap! Slap)<BR>
That nods and bends in the breezes, Oh! (Slap! Slap!)<BR>
And my heart (Slap!) is as light (Slap!) as the wind that blows (Slap! Slap!)<BR>
The leaves from off the treeses, Oh! (Slap! SLAP!)"<P>

Pa was singing his trouble song and slapping his arms on his chest.<P></EM>

</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="bonnets.mid"><IMG
SRC="cello.gif"> All the Blue Bonnets Are Over the Border</a><P>

<EM>Round and round they marched, Laura and Carrie and Grace, singing
with all their might, thumping loud thumps of their shoes on the floor.<P>

"Mount and make ready, then,<BR>
Sons of the mountain glen,<BR>
Fight! for your homes and the old Scottish glory!"<P>

They felt that banners were blowing above them and that they were 
marching to victory.  They did not even hear the storm.  They were
warm to the tips of their toes.<P></EM>

</strong></font><P>

<A HREF="graymare.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> The Old Gray Mare</A> and

<EM>Pa played and sang "Little Annie Rooney is my Sweetheart!" and 
"The Old Gray Mare, She Ain't What She Used to Be," till even Ma's toes
were keeping time to it.  He played the Highland Fling, and Irish jigs,
and out on the clickety-clattering floor Laura and Carrie danced till their
breath was gone.</EM><P>

<A HREF="intsbab.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif">

<EM>After dinner Pa played hymn tunes on his fiddle, and all the
afternoon they sang.  They sang:<P>

"There's a land that is fairer than day,<BR>
And by faith we can see it afar..."<P>

And:<P>

"Jesus is a rock in a weary land,<BR>
A weary land, a weary land<BR>
Jesus is a rock in a weary land,<BR>

<EM>No one cheered.  It was more like a moment to say, "Amen."  But 
no one quite knew what to do.<P>

Then Pa began to sing.  All at once everyone was singing,<P>

"My country, 'tis of thee,<BR>
Sweet land of liberty,<BR>
Of thee I sing..."<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>Little Town on the Prairie, <em>

<EM>His mood changed, and so did the fiddle's.  They sang,<P>

"Oh, I went down south for to see my Sal,<BR>

<A HREF="jingle.mid"><IMG SRC="cello.gif"> 
Jingle Bells</a><P>

<EM>The sleigh bells were ringing, the sleigh runners squeaking on
the hard-packed snow, and Laura was so happy that she had to sing.<P>

"Jingle bells, jingle bells,<BR>
Jingle all the way!<BR>
Oh what fun it is to ride<BR>
In a one-horse open sleigh."<P>

All along the speeding line, other voices took up the tune.  Swinging
out on the open prairie and back, fast up the street and out on the 
prairie and back again, the bells went ringing and the voices singing
in the frosty air.<P></EM>

<FONT SIZE=-2><strong>These Happy Golden Years, <em>

<A HREF="usanthem.mid"><IMG

<EM>Then the band tuned up again and everybody rose.  Men and boys
took off their hats.  The band played, and everybody sang.<P>

"Oh, say, can you see by the dawn's early light,<BR>
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming..."<P>

From the top of the flagpole, up against the blue sky, the Stars and
Stripes were fluttering.  Everybody looked at the American flag, and
Almanzo sang with all his might.<P></EM>
